256-258: I beleive these lines and figures belongs to the result section since you present data results in the signal region (also you refer here to Section 7.1 that is far away). I would suggest to move this in Section 7, just before section 7.1.
Table 2: 'Others' values are now all zero -> I suggest to remove this line (eventualy adding a sentence in the text or in the caption to say that other uncertainties have an impact < 0.1%)
L364: round the significance values to 9.6 and 8.5.
Fig.6 and 7 captions: 'The post-fit distributions in the control  region for...' 'The data are compared to the ... predictions.'
Fig.6 and 7: what are the vertical dotted lines here?
L382-383: 'is 1.25+0.14-0.12(syst)+-01.2(stat) = 1.25+0.18-0.17'; same at L389-390; also we in general put stat uncertainty first.
L384: 'A combined EW+QCD cross section..'
L387: Not clear what this result is, is it for QCD only? If yes -> 'The theoretical fiducial cross section for QCD production is ..'
Table 5 caption: '.. of the unfolding of pTgamma, pTj1, pTl1 observables for EW Zgjj.' Same for Table 7.
Table 5: in some cases the number of digits given for the value and for the uncertainty does not match. E.g. -1.14-0.829+0.820 should be -1.140-0.829+0.820 or -1.14-0.83+0.82
%GREEN%Table 6: shouldn't the values be here the same as those in the unblinding slides (S17) appart from the few bins where the boundaries 
reached?%ENDCOLOR%
Table 6: as for Table 5 you should match the uncertainty precision and value precision for all bins, same also for Table 7 and 8.
L455-456: the text still refer to VBFNLO for the unitarity limit, this should be updated to Eboli's paper
Fig.10: I would merge the two plots, as here we show the data twice.
Table 9: unitary bounds need a unit
Table 9: in some case 3 decimals are given, do we trust the 3rd decimal in limit values such as -0.638?
%GREEN%Summary: I would add a sentence on the agrreement bteween measurements and predictions for the differential measurements (just after or within the sentence ending at L467).%ENDCOLOR%
